## Assignments

### 1. Self-reflection I (Canvas submission required)

In 300-500 words, respond to the following questions and prompts.

* Past: What brought you to art and SAIC? How did you get where you are?
* Present: How do you feel about where you are now as a student? As an artist? Do you identify as an Artist, and if not, how would you describe yourself?
* Future: What are you hopeful about (for yourself)? What are you worried about (for yourself)? If you don't like the binary of hopes and worries, express yourself however makes sense to you.

While reading your responses will provide me a chance to get to know you better, the main goal of this assignment is to give you space to reflect, and articulate to yourselves how you feel about where you are.
