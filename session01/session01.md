### Part 2

## Assignments

### 1-1. Self-reflection I (Canvas submission required)

In 300-500 words, respond to the following questions and prompts.

* Past: What brought you to art (or whatever your pursuit is) and SAIC? How did you get where you are?
* Present: How do you feel about where you are now as a student? As an artist? Do you identify as an Artist, and if not, how would you describe yourself?
* Future: What are you hopeful about (for yourself)? What are you worried about (for yourself)? If you don't like the binary of hopes and worries, express yourself however makes sense to you.

While reading your responses will provide me a chance to get to know you better, the main goal of this assignment is to give you space to reflect, and articulate to yourselves how you feel about where you are.

### 1-2. Freecodecamp.org tutorials: HTML and HTML5 Basics (Canvas submission required)

* Complete all **28 tutorials** from the the [Basic HTML and HTML5 course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/#basic-html-and-html5) in the Responsive Web Design Section.

### 1-3. Web Design in 4 minutes

* Read through and "do" [Web Design in 4 minutes](https://jgthms.com/web-design-in-4-minutes/) by [Jeremy Thomas](https://jgthms.com/). It really only takes 4 minutes!

### 1-4. Tool checklist

Make sure the following tools and accounts are downloaded, installed, and set up properly

1. **Web Browser:** [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/). Set either to your default browser during class time.
2. **Text Editor:** [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/). If you prefer using another Text Editor like Atom or Sublime Text, you may, but I recommend using VS Code. It's widely used, has a lot of great features, and the more we're on the same page, the better. After downloading/installing, change the following...
   1. **Settings** (the gear icon in the bottom left, you can search for these)
      1. Autosave: afterDelay
      2. Compact Folders: unchecked
   2. **View** (at the top bar of VS Code)
      1. View --> Wordwrap (on)
      2. View --> Show Minimap (off)
   3. **Extensions** (the icon with 4 blocks on the left bar)
      1. Live Server (by Ritwick Dey)
3. **GitHub**: Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) using your SAIC email address.
   1. Create a repository for this class with the class title and your name (e.g. webart-dougrosman)
   2. In the settings for that repo (not your general GitHub settings), enable GitHub Pages by setting your Branch to 'main', then hit 'Save'.
4. **GitHub Desktop**: Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
5. **CodePen.io**: Create an account on [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io/). You can choose "sign up with your GitHub account"
6. **Freecodecamp.org**: Create an account on [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). You can choose "sign up with your GitHub account". After doing that, change the following in your Settings:
   1. make your username your first and last name (e.g., dougrosman). Make sure to hit 'Save'
   2. Scroll down to your Privacy Settings, and set the following to 'Public':
      1. My Profile
      2. My timeline
